Hi.
In this video, I'm going to proove this theorem.
Let's see the statement of the Theorem.

The Lebesgue measure space, "Real Numbers", "R", "M", "mew", is translation invariant, that is, for every "E" and "x", then we have.
first,
"E" plus x is a element of "M",
and
"mew" of "E" plus x equals to "mew" of "E".
second,
for every "x",let
"M" + x
be set of "E" + x
such that "E" is a element of "M"
then,
"M" + x
equals to "M".


for, prerequisite, you have to recognize that the Lebesgue Outer Measure "Mew" is translation invariant, that is, "Mew" of E plus x equals to "Mew" of "E".


so, let's prove.


let me show the first statement.
For every "E", "x", and "a",
"mew" of "A" cap "E" plus x,
plus
"mew" of "A" cap complement of "E" plus "x",
equals
"mew" of
