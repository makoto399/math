Hi.
In this video, I'm going to prove Translation Invariance of the Lebesgue Measure.
Let's see the statement of the Theorem.
,,,
The Lebesgue measure space, real numbers, "R", sigma algebra, "M", measure, "mew", is translation invariant, that is, for every "E" and "x", then we have, 
First, "E" plus x is an element of "M",
such that "E" plus x, is defined as, the set of elements of small "e" added with x.
and mew of "E" plus x equals to mew of "E",
Second, for every "x",
let "M" + x be, set of "E" + x,
such that "E" is a element of "M",
then "M" + x equals to "M".
,,,
Before proceeding to proof, to make the proof simple, I am going to set prerequisites.
You have to recognize that the Lebesgue "outer" Measure is translation invariant, that is, mew of "E" plus x equals to mew of "E".
Note that this is for the Lebesgue "Outer" Measure, but this theorem for the Lebesgue Measure.
If you want to check proof, please visit the previously posted video, number 3, "Translation Invariance of the Lebesgue Outer Measure".
,,,
So, let's prove.
Let me show the first statement.
Let mew be the Lebesgue outer measure.
For every "E", "x", and "a",
mew of "A" cap "E" plus x,
plus mew of "A" cap complement of "E" plus x,
equals mew of "A" cap "E" plus x,
plus mew of "A" cap complement of "E" plus x,
the difference between before and after is the place of complement,
and this equals mew of "A" cap "E" plus x "minus x",
plus mew of "A" cap complement of "E" plus x, "minus x",
which comes from the Lebesgue outer measure is translation invariant, of prerequisite, here,
and this equals mew of "A" minus x cap "E",
plus mew of "A" minus x cap complement of "E",
since these sets are mutually equal in a sense of set,
and then equals to mew of "A" minus x, equals mew of "A", 
which comes from the Lebesgue outer measure is translation invariant, of prerequisite, here,
then, "E" plus x is an element of "M".
Also by the definition of the Lebesgue measure and the translation invariance of the Lebesgue "outer" measure,
mew of "E" plus x, equals mew of "E".
Thus, we proved.
For second statement, I skip to prove because it's easy to show by the same argument of the first statement.
That' all.
If you have any comments or questions, I'd appreciate your comments, thank you.
