```
Unigueness of Lebesgue Decomposition
```

Let $(X, \mathfrak{A})$ be a measurable space, and let $\mu$ be a positive measure and $\lambda$ be a $\sigma$-finite signed measure on $(X, \mathfrak{A})$.

If there exists a Lebesgue Decomposition of $\lambda$ with respect to $\mu$, then it is unique.
