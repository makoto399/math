Jordan Decomposition Theorem
```

Let $(X, \mathfrak{A}, \lambda)$ be a signed measure space, let $\{A, B\}$ be the Hahn Decomposition, and let $\{\mu, v\}$ a set of signed measures defined as
$
\mu(E):=\lambda(E\cap A)
$
and
$
\mu(E):=-\lambda(E\cap B)
$
 for $E\in\mathfrak{A}$.

Then 

$$
\mu \perp v,
$$

at least one of which is finite, and $\lambda=v-\mu$ on $\mathfrak{A}$.
