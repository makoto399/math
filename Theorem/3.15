Hi.
In this video, I'm going to prove Translation Invariance of the Lebesgue Outer Measure.
Let's see the statement of the Theorem.
'''
Let mew be the Lebesgue outer measure.
For every "E", and "x", we have,
mew of "E" plus "x" equals to mew of "E",
such that, "E" plus x is defined as, a set of, small "e" plus x.
'''
Prerequisites.
There is nothing special to mention.
'''
So, Lets prove.
Let, "I", be an arbitrary set of, left-closed right_open intervals, such that, the union of, "I", "n", over all "n", includes, "E".
Then, "E" + x, is a subset of, the union of, "I", "n", + x,
and equals to, the union of, "I", "n", + "x".
Since mew is infimum over all sets of intervals such that cover the set, "E",
mew of, "E" plus x, is lesss than or equals to, summation of, "l" of, "I", "n" plus "x",
such that, "l" is the length of the interval.
also, equals to, summation of "l" of, "I", "n",
which comes from that the length of an interval is invariant if an interval moves parallel.
Since "I" is arbitrary, take infimum over all "I", this leads to that mew of, "E" plus x is less than or equals to mew of "E".
Since "x" is taken arbitrarily, the opposite can be easily shown.
Thus, we proved.
If you have any comments or questions, I'd appreciate your comments, thank you.
