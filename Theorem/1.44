Hi.
In this video, I'm going to prove Theorem of Image Measure.
Let's see the statement of the Theorem.
'''
Given two measurable spaces, "X", sigma algebra, "A", and, "Y", sigma algebra, "B",
Let "f" be a "A","B", measurable mapping of, "X" into, "Y".
Let mew be a measure on "A".
The set function "v" is defined by, mew, circle, "f" inverse, on "B", is a measure on "B".
'''
Prerequisites.
There is nothing special to mention.
'''
So, Lets prove.
First, by the positiveness of mew, so is "v".
Second, "v" of empty set, equals to, mew of, f inverse of, empty set.
and equals to, mew of empty set,
which comes from that the image of empty set is emptyset,
this equals to 0,
which comes from that mew is measure.
Third, let "B" be a sequence in "B", such that for arbitrary, "m", "n", satisfying "m" does'nt eqauls to "n",
"B", "m", and, "B", "n", are mutually disjoint.
Then, "v" of union of, "B", "n", over all "n", equals to mew of, f inverse of, union of, "B", "n", over all "n", by the definition of "v".
then equals to, mew of union of, f inverse of, "B", "n",over all "n",
by the property of, f inverse.
then equals to, summation of mew of, f inverse of, "B", "n", over all "n", which comes from that measure mew is completely additive.
then equals to, summation of "v" of, "B", "n", by the definition of "v".
Thus, we proved that mew is a measure.
If you have any comments or questions, I'd appreciate your comments, thank you.
