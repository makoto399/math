Borel Regularity of the Lebesgue Outer Measure
---

Let $\mu^*_L$ be the Lebesgue outer measure on $\mathbb{R}$.

Then `1` ~ `3` below hold.

`1.`

For every $E\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\epsilon>0$ there exists an open set $O$ such that $E \subset O$ and

$$
\mu^*_L(E)
\leq 
\mu^*_L(O)
\leq
\mu^*_L(E) + \epsilon.
$$

`2.`

For every $E\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$ there exists an $G_\delta$-set $G$ such that $E \subset G$ and

$$ 
\mu^*(G)=\mu^*(E).
$$


`3.`

$\mu^*_L$ is a Borel regular outer measure.

Proof

`1.`

By the definition of $\mu^*_L$, for arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$ we can take a set of open sets $\{I_n: n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ such that

$$
\mu_L^*\left( E \right)
\leq \mu_L^*\left( \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} I_n \right)
\leq\mu_L^*\left( E \right) + \epsilon
$$

Since $\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} I_n$ is also open, we proved.


`2.`

By `1.`, for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ we can take open set $O_n$ such that

$$
\mu_L^*\left( E \right)
\leq \mu_L^*\left( O_n \right)
\leq\mu_L^*\left( E \right) + \frac{1}{n}
$$

Let $G_{\delta}$-set $G$ be

$$
G:=\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}} O_n
$$

Since $G\subset O_n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we get

$$
\mu^*_L(G) \leq \mu^*_L(E)
$$

On the other hand, since $E\subset O_n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we get

$$
E\subset \bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}} O_n =G
$$

which means

$$
\mu^*_L(E) \leq \mu^*_L(G)
$$

Thus we proved.
