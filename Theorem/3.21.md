Borel Regularity of the Lebesgue Outer Measure
```
Let $\mu^*_L$ be the Lebesgue Outer Measure on $\mathbb{R}$.

Then `1` ~ `3` below hold.

`1.`

For every $E\in\mathfrak{P}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\epsilon>0$ there exists an open set $O$ such that
$
E \subset O
$
and

$$
\mu^*_L(E)
\leq 
\mu^*_L(O)
\leq
\mu^*_L(E) + \epsilon.
$$

`2.`

For every $E\in\mathfrak{P}(\mathbb{R})$ there exists an $G_\delta$-set $G$ such that
$
E \subset G
$
and

$$ 
\mu^*(G)=\mu^*(E).
$$


`3.`
$\mu^*_L$ is a Borel regular outer measure.

Prerequisite Definition
```


`a.`
a countable union of open sets is called "$G_\sigma$-set"

`b.`

An outer measure $\mu^*$ on a topological space $X$ is called "a Borel outer measure" if
$$
\mathfrak{B}_X \subset \mathfrak{M}(\mu^*)
$$
such that $\mathfrak{M}(\mu^*)$ is the collection of all $\mu^*$-measurable sets of $X$.

`c.`

A Borel outer measure is called "a Borel regular outer measure" if for every $E \in \mathfrak{P}(X)$ there exists $F\in\mathfrak{B}(X)$ such that
$$
E \subset F
$$
and
$$
\mu^*(F)=\mu^*(E).
