Hopf Extension Theorem
```

Let $X$ be a set, let $\mathfrak{A}$ be an algebra of subsets of $X$, and let $\mu$ be a nonnegative extended real-valued additive set function on $\mathfrak{A}$ with $\mu(\emptyset)$=0.

Then $\mu$ is extendible to a measure on $X$ if and only if $\mu$ is countably additive on $\mathfrak{A}$.
