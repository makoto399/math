Hi.
In this video, I'm going to prove Monotone Convergence Theorem for Sequences of Measurable Sets.
Let's see the statement of the Theorem.
'''
Let mew be a measure on a sigma algebra, "A", of subsets of a set, "X", and let, "E", n, be a monotone sequence in, "A".
First, if, "E", "n", is monotonicaly increasing, then,
limit of mew of, "E", "n", equals to, mew of limit of, "E", "n".
Second, if, "E", "n", is monotonicaly decreasing, then, the same statement of above, but with condition that, there exists a set, "A", such that, the measure of, "A", is finite, and "A" includes, "E1".
More simply, this can be replaced by, all "E", "n", has finite measure.
'''
Before proceeding to proof, to make the proof simple, I am going to set prerequisites.
First, let, "E", "n", be a monotonically increasing sequence in a sigam algebra, then,
the limit of, "E", "n", equals to cup over all, "n", of, "E", "n".
On the other hand, if decreasing, then,
the limit of, "E", "n", equals to cap over all, "n", of, "E", "n".
Second, let mew be a measure on a sigma algebra, "A", then, for all, "E1", "E2", such that, "E1", is a subset of, "E2",
and, measure of, "E1", is finite, we have, mew of, "E2", minus, "E1", equals to, mew of, "E2", minus, mew of "E1".
'''
So, Lets prove.
First, consider there exists, "n0", such that, mew of, "E", "n0", equals to infinity, then, by monotonicity of set of, "E", "n", and, monotonicity of measure mew of, we have, limit of mew of, "E", "n", equals to infinity.
On the other hand, since, "E", "n0", is a subset of, union of, "E", "n",
we have, infinity equals to, mew of, "E", "n0",
and is less than or equals to, mew of, union, "E", "n",
which comes from the monotonicity of measure mew,
and equals to, mew of, limit, "E", "n",
by the prerequisite 1.
Thus, limit of mew of, "E", "n", equals to, mew of, limit of, "E", "n".
Second, consider the case for any, n, mew of, "E", "n", is finite.
we define for any, n, "F", "n", as, "E", "n", minus, "E", "n",minus 1, with, "E0", defined as empty set,
then, union of, "E", "n", equals to, union of, "F", "n".
please look at this union, for, "F", you would note that, "F" are mutually disjoint by the definiton of, "F". 
Thus, mew of, limit of, "E", "n", equals to, mew of, union of, "E", "n", by the prerequisite 1,
and equals to, mew of, union of, "F", "n", by the above,
and equals to, mew of, summation of, mew of, "F", "n", by the monotone property of measure, mew,
and equals to, mew of, summation of, mew of, "E", "n", minus, "E", "n", minus 1, by the definition of, "F".
by the fact that..........

If you have any comments or questions, I'd appreciate your comments, thank you.
