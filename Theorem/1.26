Hi.
In this video, I'm going to prove Monotone Convergence Theorem for Sequences of Measurable Sets.
Let's see the statement of the Theorem.
'''
Let mew be a measure on a sigma algebra, "A", of subsets of a set, "X", and let, "E", "n", be a monotone sequence in, "A ".
First, if, "E", "n", is monotonicaly increasing, then,
limit of mew of, "E", "n", equals to, mew of limit of, "E", "n".
Second, if, "E", "n", is monotonicaly decreasing, then, the same statement of above, but with condition that, there exists a set, "A", such that, the measure of, "A", is finite, and "A" includes, "E", "1".
More simply, this can be replaced by, all "E", "n", has finite measure.
'''
Before proceeding to proof, to make the proof simple, I am going to set prerequisites.
First, let, "E", "n", be a monotonically increasing sequence in a sigam algebra, then,
the limit of, "E", "n", equals to cup over all, "n", of, "E", "n".
On the other hand, if decreasing, then,
the limit of, "E", "n", equals to cap over all, "n", of, "E", "n".
Second, let mew be a measure on a sigma algebra, "A", then, for all, "E", 1, "E", 2, such that, "E", 1, is a subset of, "E", 2,
and, measure of, "E", 1, is finite, we have, mew of, "E", 2, minus, "E", 1, equals to, mew of, "E", 2, minus, mew of "E", 1.

So, Lets prove.
First,
If you have any comments or questions, I'd appreciate your comments, thank you.
