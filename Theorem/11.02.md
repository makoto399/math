```
Uniqueness of the Radon-Nikodym Derivative
```

Let $(X, \mathfrak{A})$ be a measurable space, let $\mu$ and $\lambda$ be a $\sigma$-finite positive measure and a signed measure on $(X, \mathfrak{A})$, respectively.

If $\mathfrak{A}$-measurable functions $f$ and $g$ on $X$ are Radon-Nikodym derivatives of $\lambda$ with respect to $\mu$, then 

$$
f=g \ \ a.e. \ on \ X.
$$
