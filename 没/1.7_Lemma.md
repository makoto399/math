Lemma 1.7
```

Let $(A_n: n\in \mathbb{N})$ be a sequence of subsets of a set  X. 

Then

`1`. 

$$
\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty} A_n
=
\{
    x \in X:
    x \in A_n \ for \ all \ but \ finitely \ many \ n \in \mathbb{N}
\}
$$

`2`.

$$
\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty} A_n
=
\{
    x \in X:
    x \in A_n \ for \ infinitely \ many \ n \in \mathbb{N}
\}
$$


```
proof
```

`1`.

First,

Let $x$ be in the left side.

By the definition,

$$
\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty} A_n
:=
\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}
\bigcap_{n \leq k}
A_k
$$

there exists some $n_0$
such that for all $n_0\leq k$, $x \in A_k$.

Then, $x$ exists in the right side.

Second,

Let $x$ be in the right side.

By the definition, there exists some large $n_0$ such that $n_0 \leq k$, $x \in A_k$.

This shows that x exists in the left side.

`2.`

Almost same as 1.
